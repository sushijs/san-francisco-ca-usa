# SushiJS Code of Conduct
All attendees at SushiJS are required to agree with the following code of
conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are
expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment
for everybody

*tl;dr: Don't be a jerk.*.

## Need Help?

If you have any questions or comments, before, during or after any SushiJS
event, fill free to contact:

## The Quick Version

SushiJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
size, race or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate. Attendees violating these rules
may be asked to leave at the discretion of the organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal and non-verbal communications related to
gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and
unwelcome sexual attention.

Don’t make Brian Ford sad.

Attendees asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If an attendee engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any
action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from
current and all future SushiJS events.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have
any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

We expect attendees to follow these rules at all times during SushiJS.
